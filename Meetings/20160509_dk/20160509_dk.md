When viewing a polygon, you can figure out if a point falls inside by seeing how many boundaries of the polygon it crosses. 
When moving the the right of a point (or any chosen direction so long as it's consistent between polygons), the point is 
inside the polygon is it only crosses 1 boundary. If it crosses 2 boundaries it is outside the polygon. Therefore, odd numbers represent being inside and even numbers represent being outside of the polygon.
